Redemptorist Priests Rev. Fr. Gino Henriques &amp; Rev. Fr. Shanti Abeysingha conducted a youth
program at St Mary&#x27;s and introduced a more vibrant style of music to the Mass. The parish priest at that time
was Fr. Basil Weeratunge, and his Assistant was Rev. Fr. Reginald Saparamadhu. It was in many
ways an off-shoot of the St. Mary&#x27;s Choral Group (SMCG) and Youth Choir begun by the Rome-
ordained Rev. Fr. Claver Perera when he was Assistant Parish Priest, in 1967 as it comprised mostly
the members of those choirs.</p><p>The initial selection of the youth choir music comprised of songs such as; <em>My Sweet Lord, I&#x27;d like to teach the world to sing</em> , and selections from the off-Broadway musical <em>Godspell</em>.</p><p>The choir grew informally by word of mouth, the average age being 19. Soon the choir was singing at
the 8.30am Sunday mass, continuing to call themselves the Youth Choir - maybe justified by the
selection of music and youthful attitude of its members some of whom may not technically have
been youth anymore! Perhaps the name was also prompted by the fact that St Mary’s has for many
years prided itself in having an outstanding Church Choir conducted at that time by renowned late
Prof. Earle de Fonseka with a membership of many renowned singers including the late Lorraine
Abeysekera, Bede de Zilwa, and Mary Anne David - the last still contributes to the music world.
Hence the label youth choir was more an aspect of differentiation!</p><p>Though it initially began with guitars, there was the addition of an organ which accompanied a
mixture of modern songs and ballads such as He aint heavy he’s my brother and songs by the
Beatles, Bread, Blood Sweat and Tears and Queen. More instruments such as bass and electric
guitars, saxophone, piano, clarinet and flute were added in 1978.</p><p>In 1980 Fr. Claver, the new parish priest guided the Youth Choir and introduced serious mixed voice
choral harmonies. He further shared his experience in Italy. Fr. Claver built up the Choir&#x27;s repertoire
in Choral music and plainchant. The Parish invested in a Viscount Domus 8 organ for the church,
further enriching the standard of the choir. In 1986 the choir under the direction of Fr. Claver,
released its first cassette titled Pass it On which was popular and widely sought.</p><p>The choir went on to perform at concert venues, hotels in Colombo, Choral festivals and at the
National Seminary in Ampitiya. A major milestone was its participation in the Mozart Death
Bicentenary Choral Festival held at the Anglican Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour by the late
Kalasuri Lylie Godridge. The introduction of a Yamaha EL90, enhanced the singing further with a
wider repertoire.</p><p>In June 2007 the choir changed its name to St. Mary&#x27;s Choral Group or SMCG, a name dating from
Fr. Claver&#x27;s original male voice choir of 1967. The choir still sings at the 8.30am Sunday Eucharistic
Celebration which is its primary function.</p><p>It also sings for the Church Feast, selected other major Feasts of the Church, Easter Tridium services
the annual Carol Service, and Christmas Midnight Mass. Most of its current members are non-
parishioners, and are students or working professionals, giving of their time and talent. It could be
said that the secret of its continuity and success in singing comes from a common love of music, and
good camaraderie and a solid foundation laid by Fr. Claver and many of its past conductors /
directors. By the presence of several generations of its past and present members continuing to
contribute and sing for the love of it and in the realisation that good music, makes the liturgy more
inspirational. The challenge it faces is the need to keep the momentum with bringing in new
members, new thinking ,and expansion of its repertoire ,to be constantly innovating so that
especially the liturgy would be living and evolving for the better.</p><div class="col-8" style="margin:auto"><p><picture class="img-content"><source type="image/webp" data-srcset="/st-marys-colombo4/_next/static/images/choral_group-c28d9e16d88caffcb040a4333a6dbc34.jpeg.webp"/><source type="image/png" data-srcset="/st-marys-colombo4/_next/static/images/choral_group-35b0f78ec4e45022da239cad254a0076.jpeg"/><img class="lazyload blur img-content img-content" alt="St. Mary’s Choral Group" src="/st-marys-colombo4/_next/static/images/choral_group-c28d9e16d88caffcb040a4333a6dbc34.jpeg.webp"/></picture></p></div></div><hr class="mt-4"/></article></main><div class="row"><div class="col"><footer class="text-lg font-light">© <!-- -->2023<!-- -->, St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bambalapitiya</footer></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Parish Choir","description":"Parish Choir","date":"April 16, 2020"},"post":{"content":"\nThe Parish choir sings at the 7.00am and 6.00pm mass on every\n\n\nSunday.
