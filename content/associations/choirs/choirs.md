## St. Mary’s Choral Group

The present St. Mary&#39;s Choral Group began as the Youth Choir of St. Mary&#39;s Church in 1973 when
Redemptorist Priests Rev. Fr. Gino Henriques &amp; Rev. Fr. Shanti Abeysingha conducted a youth
program at St Mary&#39;s and introduced a more vibrant style of music to the Mass. The parish priest at that time
was Fr. Basil Weeratunge, and his Assistant was Rev. Fr. Reginald Saparamadhu. It was in many
ways an off-shoot of the St. Mary&#39;s Choral Group (SMCG) and Youth Choir begun by the Rome-
ordained Rev. Fr. Claver Perera when he was Assistant Parish Priest, in 1967 as it comprised mostly
the members of those choirs.

The initial selection of the youth choir music comprised of songs such as; *My Sweet Lord, I&#39;d like to teach the world to sing* , and selections from the off-Broadway musical *Godspell*.

The choir grew informally by word of mouth, the average age being 19. Soon the choir was singing at the 8.30am Sunday mass, continuing to call themselves the Youth Choir - maybe justified by the selection of music and youthful attitude of its members some of whom may not technically have been youth anymore! Perhaps the name was also prompted by the fact that St Mary’s has for many years prided itself in having an outstanding Church Choir conducted at that time by renowned late
Prof. Earle de Fonseka with a membership of many renowned singers including the late Lorraine Abeysekera, Bede de Zilwa, and Mary Anne David - the last still contributes to the music world. Hence the label youth choir was more an aspect of differentiation!

Though it initially began with guitars, there was the addition of an organ which accompanied a mixture of modern songs and ballads such as He aint heavy he’s my brother and songs by the Beatles, Bread, Blood Sweat and Tears and Queen. More instruments such as bass and electric guitars, saxophone, piano, clarinet and flute were added in 1978.

In 1980 Fr. Claver, the new parish priest guided the Youth Choir and introduced serious mixed voice choral harmonies. He further shared his experience in Italy. Fr. Claver built up the Choir&#39;s repertoire in Choral music and plainchant. The Parish invested in a Viscount Domus 8 organ for the church, further enriching the standard of the choir. In 1986 the choir under the direction of Fr. Claver, released its first cassette titled Pass it On which was popular and widely sought.

The choir went on to perform at concert venues, hotels in Colombo, Choral festivals and at the National Seminary in Ampitiya. A major milestone was its participation in the Mozart Death Bicentenary Choral Festival held at the Anglican Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour by the late Kalasuri Lylie Godridge. The introduction of a Yamaha EL90 in 1995, expanded the repertoire that could be sung.  In September 2023, with the support of generous donors and benefactors from within the broader SMCG community around the world, a Johannus Vivaldi 370 organ from the Netherlands was introduced, with a state-of-the-art sound system added in time for Christmas 2023, which enhanced the possibilities for inspiring singing further, now with authentic pipe organ sounds.

In June 2007 the choir changed its name to St. Mary&#39;s Choral Group or SMCG, a name dating from Fr. Claver&#39;s original male voice choir of 1967. The choir still sings at the 8.30am Sunday Eucharistic Celebration which is its primary function.

It also sings for the Church Feast, selected other major Feasts of the Church, Easter Tridium services the annual Carol Service, and Christmas Midnight Mass. Most of its current members are non-parishioners, and are students or working professionals, giving of their time and talent since their early childhood, for even a lifetime. It could be said that the secret of its continuity and success in singing comes from a common love of music, and good camaraderie and a solid foundation laid by Fr. Claver and many of its past conductors / directors. By the presence of several generations of its past and present members continuing to contribute and sing for the love of singing and serving the Lord, and in the realisation that good music composed for this very purpose over the past millennium for the great cathedrals of Europe, uplifts the liturgy. 

As it approaches its 60th year, the challenge it faces is the need to keep the momentum with bringing in new members, new thinking, and expansion of its repertoire in ordet to better serve the liturgical needs of the Church.
